      "Faulty touchscreen of the device, contacted Amazon customer care for device replacement (as per replacement policy within 7 days against manufacturing defects). So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!) No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector - Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. - With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box. 3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking option Will come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks. After purchasing a phone worth up to 90k, i had to do all this and still no support from Amazon.\n"
